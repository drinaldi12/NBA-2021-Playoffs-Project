# NBA-2021-Playoffs-Project

This repository contains my Python analysis of a dataset involving four basketball players shooting data from the 2021 NBA playoffs. The scenario come from DataCamp, a website that focuses on teaching data skills and AI through videos and computer exercises. This project focuses on providing insights that could allow other coachs of college leagues see that usefulness of data analysis that could be applied to their own players. 

# Background

This scenario involves interest from a college basketball team, hiring me to provide insights from data that will be used to improve their performance in the sport. Specifically, they are looking to see whether or not I am able to use past NBA shooting data to provide recommendations that are tailored to different players. As a test, the manager of the team is asking whether or not it's possible to provide player recommendations based on the chances of making a shot. This should include the reliability of the findings and advice for each player. The report should be accessible to a broad audience and outline the steps, findings, and conclusions.
